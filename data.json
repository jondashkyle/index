    "text": "# Shattered Streams\n\nShattered Streams was a website which went online May 1st, 2016. Thirty musicians were comissioned to contribute a sound loop, each one streaming for only 24 hours, disintegrating as the day passed. The site went offline May 31st, when no loops remained.\n\n## Musical Ephemerality\n\nSound reproduction and recorded music are inseperable from storage and transmission. While some formats are most commonly associatedd with being forms of technology (CDs, iPods), all are technological (phonographs, vinyl).\n\nComparisons of analog and digital often veer towards cliche; those of aesthetics and warmth, or persuits of ever purer listening, afforded only through increasingly unaffordable equipment upgrades.\n\nChoosing to ignore these tropes, instead focus on gradations of temporality and access as popular technology morphs over time. Yes, you now have unlimited and immediate access to a metaphorically infite library of music with a Spotify subscription, until the license to your favorite record is revoked or the network goes down.\n\n## Background\n\nShattered Streams came about when Brian Simon (Anenon) had the idea to create a music application which would degrade a song each time you listened to it, approximating the damage done by a needle when passing over the grooves of a vinyl record.\n\n## Questions\n\nIn what way does unlimited and immediate access to a metaphorically infinite library mold your relation to the music?\n\nIn what way does your relation to the music change when that access is restricted or removed?\n\nHow does the subconcious awareness of slowly destroying your favorites shape your relation to them?\n\n\n## WIP\n\nThis isn’t a condition unique to digital. Nolstalgic tendencies associated with analog, those of impermanence and fading create a sense of uniqueness.\n\n- Music as topic to expand on ideas of decentralization, network dependence and offline first.\n- Digital is lossless, but is not a neutral medium.\n- Streaming as discreet performance, improvisational playback\n- Relationship with a listener and a favorite piece of music when through analog (degrading) and digital (endless) playback.\n- Performance\n\n## Digital Degredation\n\n- Media formats\n- Streaming wars\n\n## Contributing artists in order of playback\n\nAnenon, William Basinski, Fatima Al Qadiri, Eluvium, Patten, Joey Anderson, Claude Speeed, White Visitation, Fennesz, Klara Lewis, Beatrice Dillon, Zebra Katz, Aurora Halal, EVOL, Jefre Cantu-Ledesma, M.

Both parents were members of the same top 40s coverband. My father went on to engineer studio sessions and produce groups. During the late 90s he also created a proto-social-network for indipendent musicians to resource share online. Growing up in the studio I watched him program both MIDI and HTML.\n\n- Is this too personal?\n- Should set an understanding of the media landscape of the late 90s, the transition from CD to iTunes to streaming.\n---",
