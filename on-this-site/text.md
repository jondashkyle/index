wanted to get something up which has more information about past projects, without exposing much detail.

it’s continuing to use [the index](https://github.com/jondashkyle/index) as a data source, and [spod](https://github.com/jondashkyle/spod) to manage it. [choo](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo) released v5, which has an api i’m very into, so that’s now used for the front-end. you can see how it’s being used here by taking a look at [the source](https://github.com/jondashkyle/jon-kyle.com/blob/master/source/index.js).
