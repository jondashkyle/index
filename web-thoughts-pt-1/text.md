small sites,
smaller tools,
keep it basic.

there is no seperation of design & build,
or design & programming,
or whatever.

## repeat these instructions until the project is complete

- finish the project,
  figure out what it actually is,
  scrap all of it.
- finish the project twice,
  figure out what it is,
  scrap half of it.
- finish the project thrice,
  figure out what it is,
  scrap a third of it.

## some ambiguous specifics

- for design,
  sketch or browser,
  no adobe or whatever,
  typography for the most part,
  keep it basic! 
- for dev,
  browserify,
  no webpack or whatever,
  es3 for the most part,
  keep it basic!

## data

with data structures and state, keep it flat as possible. chances are you don’t know what the structure is, so avoid nesting. if you need it, store a reference to it’s unique id.

always use `objects`. no `arrays`. turn the values of the `object` into an `array` and use methods like `filter`, `map`, `reduce` and `sort`.

## remember the audience

design and build sites for the worst machines and the worst connections. accessibility. don’t keep the data. opt in, not out.

compress. minify. gzip. keep the size down. keep it fast.

big ups to choo. small, opinionated, community built, and not sponsored by an corperate boheamoth.
