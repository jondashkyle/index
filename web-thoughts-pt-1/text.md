## data

with data structures and state, keep it flat as possible. chances are you don’t know what the structure is, so avoid nesting. if you need it, store a reference to it’s unique id.

always use `objects`. no `arrays`. turn the values of the `object` into an `array` and use methods like `filter`, `map`, `reduce` and `sort`.

## visitors

design and build sites for the worst machines and the worst connections. accessibility. don’t keep the data. opt in, not out.

compress. minify. gzip. keep the size down. keep it fast.

big ups to choo. small, opinionated, community built, and not sponsored by an corperate boheamoth.
